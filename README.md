# earthbound-battle-backgrounds
This project acts as a library to render Earthbound's battle backgrounds. You can render the results in a browser or even on the server.
## What is this?
Earthbound, also known as *Mother 2* in Japan, is a SNES game released in 1994. This project displays Earthbound's battle backgrounds. In order to render the frames, currently a [Canvas 2D context](https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext/) is used. I'd be happy to use a [WebGL 2 context](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/2.0/) once support is more wide-spread.
## Is there a demo?
Yes. You can find a full-screen demo [here](https://kdex.github.io/earthbound-battle-backgrounds).
- Use `[←]` and `[→]` to change layer 1.
- Use `[↑]` and `[↓]` to change layer 2.

If you edit the URL manually, you can also add/remove layers.

The source code for the demo can be found [here](https://github.com/kdex/kdex.github.io/tree/master/earthbound-battle-backgrounds).
## Installation
```bash
$ npm i -S earthbound-battle-backgrounds
```
## Example
This code is more or less equivalent to the demo from above, minus the key events.
```js
import { BackgroundLayer, Engine } from "earthbound-battle-backgrounds";
/* Create animation engine  */
const engine = new Engine([new BackgroundLayer(153), new BackgroundLayer(298)], {
	canvas: document.querySelector("#target-canvas");
});
engine.animate();
```
## API
There are two exports in the package, namely `BackgroundLayer` and `Engine`.
### BackgroundLayer
#### `constructor(entry)`
Creates a new `BackgroundLayer` displaying `entry`. Note that entry is bounded by `BackgroundLayer.MINIMUM_LAYER` and `BackgroundLayer.MAXIMUM_LAYER`.
### Engine
#### `constructor(layers, options)`
##### Description
Constructs a new `Engine`, which can be used to render `BackgroundLayer`s.
##### Signature
- layers: `Array<BackgroundLayer>` (default: `[]`)
	
	The array of `BackgroundLayer` instances to render.
- options: `object`
	
	An object containing rendering options.
	- options.fps: `number` (default: `30`)

		The framerate to render with.
	- options.aspectRatio: `number` (default: `0`)

		The aspect ratio to render with.
	- options.frameSkip: `number` (default: `1`)

		The engine is time-dependent and uses an internal clock that will be incremented after each frame. This number decides by which constant the clock is incremented.
	- options.alpha: `Array<number>` (default: `Engine.computeAlphas(layers.map(layer => layer.entry))`)

		An array that specifies the opacity for each `BackgroundLayer` in `layers`. The default is to give each layer the same opacity so that all alphas sum up to `1`. Layer `0` is ignored, as it does not display anything.
	- options.canvas: `CanvasElement` (default: `document.querySelector("canvas")`)

		The canvas element to render to.

#### `static computeAlphas(entries)`
##### Description
Computes an array of `alpha` values so that every valid layer gets the same opacity.
##### Signature
- entries: `Array<number>`

	An array where every number must be a number must be at least `BackgroundLayer.MINIMUM_LAYER`, and at most `BackgroundLayer.MAXIMUM_LAYER`.
#### `rewind()`
##### Description
Resets the internal engine timer to `0`. This will cause all `BackgroundLayer`s to be rendered in their initial state.
##### Signature
*Nullary.*
#### `animate()`
##### Description
Runs the engine. This will cause frames to be drawn on the instance's `canvas`.
##### Signature
*Nullary.*
## Project maintenance history
- In 2008, the code for this project started out on [PK Hack](http://starmen.net/pkhack/) as a [Windows screensaver](https://forum.starmen.net/forum/Fan/Games/Kraken-EB-Battle-Animation-Screensaver/first), written in C# by [Mr. Accident](https://forum.starmen.net/members/168). Mr. Accident's source code has been published [here](https://github.com/gjtorikian/kraken).
- In 2010, [gjtorikian](https://github.com/gjtorikian) ported Mr. Accident's Windows screensaver from C# to [Java](https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds) to support Android Live screensavers.
- In 2013, gjtorikian ported his own project from Java to [ECMAScript 5](https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS) to support all devices with a web browser. He is well aware that his port is terrible (in fact, he even wrote a [dedicated section](https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS/blob/a82659ddf7a893cc46c2ba05ddf310d32ca21a17/README.md#why-is-this-code-so-terrible) in his README.md, just to reflect that).
- In 2016, [I](https://github.com/kdex) rewrote the latter in [ES2015+](https://github.com/kdex/earthbound-battle-backgrounds) for it to stay maintainable.
- In 2017, gjtorikian [copy-and-pasted my source code into his repository](https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS/issues/7). So even though the two repositories may look very similar, this one will likely be newer judging from past development.

## As a rewrite, how does this project differ?
A great portion of the code was essentially re-written. Essentially, this code…
- …provides a programmatic API instead of a GUI.
- …can therefore be consumed as a module.
- …offers a 34% lower memory footprint than the original project when rendering.
- …offers 15% more idle time.
- …offers 23% less time spent in `computeFrame()`.
- …offers an over 100% faster implementation of `romGraphics.drawTile()`.
- …highly optimizes changing the background layers at runtime; the original version will show a white flash when you're trying to change it. This project doesn't do that.
- …uses [ES2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) or later language standards.
- …doesn't use RequireJS, but ES2015 modules.
- …doesn't use functionally-scoped variable declarations (`var`), but `const` and `let`.
- …uses syntactical ES5 getters and setters instead of `getX()`- and `setX()`-style functions (cf. Java).
- …uses ES2015 classes.
- …removes UnderscoreJS-inspired functions and uses native ES2015 functions instead.
- …removes the weird and broken OOP model that had been introduced (`registerType` etc.).
- …removes notable comments such as [ugghhhhhhhhh](https://github.com/gjtorikian/Earthbound-Battle-Backgrounds-JS/blob/a82659ddf7a893cc46c2ba05ddf310d32ca21a17/src/read_bgs_dat.js#L27).
- …removes unnecessary brackets that were put everywhere.
- …removes Node Express.
- …removes that weird `LOG_TAG` variable-based logging.
- …fixes pointer math (no more padding is needed).
- …fixes minor bugs.
